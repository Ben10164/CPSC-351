### Three parts of "Theory of Computation"

1. Automata Theory
2. Compatability Theory
3. Complexity Theory

#### Automata Theory

Definition and properties of mathematical models of computation

Three major models:

1. Finite State Automata
    * Regular languages
    * Regular Grammars (and regular expressins)

2. Push down automata
   * Context Free Languages
   * Context Free Grammars

3. Turing Machines
   * Recursively Enumerable Languages
   * Phrase Structure Grammars

Another View:

* FSAs are computing models with no memory
* PDAs are computing models with stack memory
* TMs are computing models with infinite memory

#### Computability Theory

Given a Turing Machine:

* What is and is not computable?
  * Halting Problem: does a TM halt under a given input
* Decidability
  * Is string `s` a member of the language generated by grammar `g`
* Why are some problems hard and others easy?
  * Sorting is easy
  * Scheduling is hard
* How do you characterize complexity: Big O Notation
* How do you classify difficult problems

**This course is overwhelmingly about automata theory with an excursion into computability theory**

### Mathematical Notions

* Sets and operations on sets
  * Definition
  * Empty set
  * Union
    * In A and B
  * Intersection
    * In both A and B
  * Complement
    * Everything not in that set
* Sequences and tuples
  * Ordered Pair
    * (a, b)
  * Cartesian Product

* Mapping
* Domain
* Range
* Edges & Vertices
* Degree of a Vertex
* Cycle, connectied graph
* Function Types
  * Injective
    * one-to-one function
  * Surjective
    * onto function
  * Bijective (one-to-one correspondence)
    * both one-to-one and onto

Predicate or Property: Function whose range is ${T,F}$

* Let `even` be a property that maps to `T`` if its input is an even integer,`F`otherwise`

Binary Relations

* A binary relation`R`
  1. is *reflective* if for every x in the domain, xRx -> T
  1. is symmetric if for every x and y in the domain, xRy implies yRx
  1. is transitive if for evert x, y, and z in the domain, xRy and yRz implies xRz
* A equivalence relation in R is an equivalence relation if R satisfies 1, 2, 3

Relation Example:  
Define a relation on the integers numbers written: $eq_{7}$
Let $Z$ be the set of integers.
For all $i, j \in Z$, $i eq_{7}j$ if $i - j$ is a multiple of $7$

Proof:
eq7 is reflexive
i - i = 0 which is a multiple of 7 (9 - 9 = 0, which is a multiple of 7)
eq7 is symmetric
i - j is a multiple of 7 if j - i is multiple of 7
said another way
Suppose j - i = p\*7, where p is the multiple.  Then i - j  = (-p)\*7, where the multiple is -p
2 - 9 = -7, a multiple of 7, so 9 - 2 = 7, a multiple of 7
eq7 is transitive
if i, j, k are integers and both (i - j) and (j - k) are multiples of 7,
then (i - j) + (j - k) = (i - k)
The sum of two multiples of 7 is a multiple of 7.  So,  (i - k) is a multiple of 7.
said another way
i - j = p\*7, j - k -  q\*7
(i-j) + (j-k) = p\*7 + q\*7
(i-k) = 7(p+q)  so (i-k) is a multiple of 7

Since eq7 is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, eq7 is an equivalence relation

### Proof Examples

1. iff

Theorem: For any two Sets, A, B, complement of A union b implies com A n com B

this is an attempt at latex. I was not fast enough so i am now just formatting it

```latex
pf
suppose X is not ian element of A union B

Step 1: $\bar{A u\ B} \implies \bar A n \bar b$
by def of comploment, X is not in A u B
x is in $\bar A$ and x is in $\bar b$

by def of intersection
x is in $\bar A$ intersects $\bar b$
which is what we want to show

Step 2
not A n not b om,plies not(a u b)
suppose x is in not a n not b, then
    x is in not a
    x is in not b
    -> def of intersection
then x is not in a u b
by def of complement
    x is in not (a u b)
    which proves step 2

since step 1 and step 2, we prove the theorem
```

```latex
Proof B: by contradiction
assume that the thing you are proving is false, then you draw a series of correct implications, it will lead to a complication (something that is not true)

Theorem:
\sqrt{2} is irrational

(rational number means a number that can be represented as a ratio of two integers (1:2, 5:100, etc), irrational is just not that)
(lemma is a subroutine, something that is easy to prove and be used inside a larger proof)

Lemma-
    if p^2 is an even integer, p is an even integer
    pf.
        p^2 is p*p
        since p^2 is even, there exists (backwards E) some L such that (S.T):
            (p^2)/2 = L
            p*p = 2L
            L = p*p)/2
            L is even


root 2 is irrational
    assume root 2 is rational
    then root 2 = m/n where m, n , are integers
    let k = gcd(m,n) <- greatest common divisor
        (m/k)/(n/k) = m/n
        let \frac{m}{k} = p
        \frac{n}{k} = q
        \sqrt{2} = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{p}{q}
        at least one of P, Q is odd
            (sub proof)
            Suppose both P, Q are even 
            \frac{m}{k} = p = 2*R
            \frac{n}{k} = q = 2*T
            -----
            So m,n would have 2k as gcd, contradicting our assumption that k is the gcd

    \sqrt 2 = m/n = p/q
    sqrt(2) q = p
        A. 2q^2 = p^2
        \implies p^2 is even! (divisible by 2)
        -> p is even by the Lemma
        since p is even, it may be written p = 2R

    2q^2 = p^2
    2q^2 = 4R^2
    q^2 - 2R^2
    q^2 is even
    -> q is even
    Both q and p are even
        but we have already shown that at least one of the two is odd       
    (contradiction!)
Assumption that \sqrt 2 is rational led to a contradiction, so \sqrt 2 is irrational
